        <p>The <b>garden strawberry</b> is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, 
            collectively known as the <b>strawberries</b>, which are cultivated worldwide for their 
            fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic <b>aroma, bright red 
            color, juicy texture, and sweetness</b>. It is consumed in large quantities, either 
            fresh or in such prepared foods as <b>jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and 
            chocolates</b>. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in 
            products such as <b>candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others</b>.</p>
            
        <p>The garden strawberry was first bred in <b>Brittany, France</b>, in the 1750s via a cross of 
            <b>Fragaria virginiana</b> from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought 
            from <b>Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714</b>. Cultivars of Fragaria ananassa have replaced, 
            in commercial production, <b>the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca)</b>, which was the 
            first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.</p>
            
        <p>From a botanical point of view, the strawberry <b>is not a berry</b> but an <b>aggregate accessory fruit</b>, 
            meaning that the fleshy part is derived <b>not from the plant's ovaries</b> but from the <b>receptacle 
            that holds the ovaries</b>. Each apparent "seed" <b>(achene)</b> on the outside of the fruit is actually 
            <b>one of the ovaries of the flower</b>, with a seed inside it.</p>
            
        <p>In 2019, world production of strawberries was <b>nine million tons</b>, led by <b>China with 40%</b> 
            of the total.</p>
